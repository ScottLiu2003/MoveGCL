MoveGCL is a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates.

## Data set
<pre><code>Our trajectory data is stored in the <code>traj_data</code> directory. Each line in the text files represents the trajectory of a single user over three consecutive days, formatted as follows: <code>1391097 0 8 1104,0,0,0,0;1137,0,9,9,1;1137,1,0,39,0;1137,2,3,51,0;1103,2,17,14,1;1137,2,22,5,1</code> In this example: - <code>1391097</code> is the user ID. - <code>0</code> is the quantized radius of gyration, denoted as \( r_{\mathrm{gyr}} \). - <code>8</code> is the quantized location entropy, denoted as \( H_{\mathrm{loc}} \). - Each following entry, such as <code>1104,0,0,0,0</code>, represents a single point in the trajectory, with the fields defined as: - <code>location_id</code>: the unique identifier of the location, - <code>day of week</code>: the day of the week (0 for Monday, ..., 6 for Sunday), - <code>time of day</code>: a time slot index within the day, - <code>t_{\mathrm{wait}}</code>: the waiting time at this location, - <code>d_{\mathrm{jump}}</code>: the jump distance from the previous location. </code></pre>
